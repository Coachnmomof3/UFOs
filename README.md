# UFOs

## Overview

The purpose of the analysis is to provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for date, city, state, country and shape at the same time.

### Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

Above are images of The UFO sightings tables that show the users capability to filter based on date, city, state, country and shape.

Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

One drawback of the design is that it doesnt capture the error and display a user friendly message if users inputs wrong data to be filtered.

It also doesnt display the results if the user inputs data with a different case than lower case.

The search criteria could be more precise with pictures of the sightings with other technical findings about the UFO sightings.

It would be a great idea to add a feature to provide a comparison for any two or more UFO sightings to find similarities or differences.
