# UFOs

## Overview

The purpose of the analysis is to provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for date, city, state, country and shape at the same time.

### Results

First step we will locate the "Enter a State" filter this is under the Filter Table section you will enter the abbreviation "ca" into the search bar then press the "Filter Table" Button. The image below displays the results of our selection with multipule lines.

Now we will filter based on city, state, and shape. As displayed in the image below there are less sightings displayed due to the specifics in our search criteria.

Above are images of The UFO sightings tables that show the users capability to filter based on date, city, state, country and shape. It also allows to search by only one variable if chosen.


## Summary

The case sensative design is a drawback that was noticed, it does not display the results if the user inputs data if the variation has any capitalized letters in the filtering area.  Including a user friendly modification such as capturing errors to display a message if users inputs unrecognizable data in the filter option would help the user understand that they need to refilter with different variables. Modifing the search results to include pictures of the sightings with references to events on findings about the UFO sightings would be great for further development.
